# Powdery Mildew in Cherry Leaves Detector

## Dataset Content

- The dataset is sourced from Kaggle. We created them a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.

- The dataset contains +4 thousand images taken from Farmy & Foods crop fields. The images show cherry leaves that are healthy and cherry leaves that contain powdery mildew, which is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants. The cherry plantation crop is one of their finest products in the portfolio and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a product of compromised quality.


## Business Requirements

- The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is to manually verify if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If it has powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees located in multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to time spent in the manual process inspection.


- To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that is capable of detecting instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project to all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

     - i. The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a cherry leaf that is healthy and that contains powdery mildew.

     - ii. The client is interested to predict if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.
